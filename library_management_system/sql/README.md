# 📚 Library Management System – SQL Query Collection

This project takes a deep dive into a Library Management System (LMS) using a series of SQL queries. It’s all about understanding how books are managed, how members interact with the library, how fines are handled, and how suppliers contribute to the system.

The dataset is structured into five main tables:

- `LMS_BOOK_DETAILS` – Information about all the books in the library  
- `LMS_BOOK_ISSUE` – Records of books borrowed and returned  
- `LMS_FINE_DETAILS` – Fine amounts and return status  
- `LMS_MEMBERS` – Member profiles and their types  
- `LMS_SUPPLIERS_DETAILS` – Details of book suppliers

## 🔍 What’s Included?

This SQL file is grouped into three parts for easy learning and exploration:

- **Basic Queries (1–10):** These cover simple tasks like viewing book lists, checking member details, and filtering fines.
- **Intermediate Queries (11–20):** This section introduces joins, grouping, and summaries—for example, finding which members borrow the most or viewing total fines per category.
- **Advanced Queries (21–30):** More complex logic here—using CTEs, window functions, and recursive queries to uncover insights like delay patterns, top books, or nested categories.

Each query is clearly labeled and commented to help you understand what it does and why it’s useful.
