# ðŸ“š Library Management System (LMS) â€“ Power BI Analysis

This project provides a complete dataset for building a **Power BI report** focused on analyzing the operations of a Library Management System (LMS). The aim is to understand how books are issued, returned, fined, and managed across different members, categories, and suppliers.

This dataset is ideal for practicing Power BI skillsâ€”data cleaning, relationships, DAX, and interactive visual storytelling.


It uses Power BI to transform raw library data into interactive reports and insights that can help in decision-making, improving user experience, and managing operations more efficiently.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

This project uses six CSV files, each representing different aspects of the library system:

- `Book_Details.csv` â€“ Contains information about each book (title, author, category, price, etc.)
- `Book_Issue.csv` â€“ Tracks which books were issued, to whom, and when they were returned
- `Fine_Details.csv` â€“ Lists fine amounts based on delay ranges
- `Lms_Members.csv` â€“ Includes details about library members and their registration info
- `Suppliers_Details.csv` â€“ Contains information about book suppliers
- `Lms_Analysis.csv` â€“ **Cleaned and fully merged dataset** combining all the above tables, used as the base for Power BI reports

> âœ… *The `Lms_Analysis.csv` file is the final, cleaned version with all key tables merged and transformed. It serves as the main source for Power BI visualizations.*
