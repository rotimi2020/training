# üìö Library Management System Using SQL

## üîç Project Overview

This project explores the design and analysis of a **Library Management System (LMS)** using SQL. It‚Äôs based on a real-world scenario where a local library manager provided access to their database and shared 30 business questions ranging from basic lookups to complex insights.

The main goal is to write and execute SQL queries that help uncover useful information about the library‚Äôs operations, book inventory, borrowing trends, member behavior, fines, and supplier performance.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- **Extract Meaningful Insights**  
  Write SQL queries to retrieve valuable data from the LMS database.

- **Answer Real Business Questions**  
  Tackle specific problems raised by the library owner to understand daily operations and member behavior.

- **Apply Advanced SQL Skills**  
  Use advanced SQL techniques like joins, CTEs, subqueries, window functions, and CASE logic to analyze trends and patterns.

- **Deliver Actionable Reports**  
  Summarize key findings to support data-driven decisions for managing the library more effectively.

## üíº Business Questions

This project was designed to help the library owner answer real business questions through SQL-based analysis:

1. **How do borrowing trends change over time?**  
   Understanding daily and seasonal borrowing patterns helps with staff planning and book availability.

2. **Which book categories and titles hold the most value?**  
   The owner wants to identify high-value books based on usage and cost to improve future purchases.

3. **Who are the most active members, and how do they behave?**  
   Explore member behavior by type (e.g. temporary vs permanent) and region to tailor services.

4. **What‚Äôs the relationship between fines and borrowing habits?**  
   Analyze fine categories, delay frequency, and patterns among members who return books late.

5. **Which books are borrowed the most, and how does that relate to supplier performance?**  
   Measure book popularity and link it to supplier performance to guide procurement decisions.

## üìå Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to run a collection of SQL queries‚Äîranging from basic to advanced‚Äîto explore and analyze data from a Library Management System (LMS) database.

The analysis focuses on key areas like book borrowing trends, member engagement, fine history, and supplier performance, helping the library owner better understand the system and make smarter decisions.

---

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used in this project represents a simplified version of a real Library Management System and includes the following core tables:

- üìò **Book Details**  
  Contains book ID, title, author, category, price, and publication date ‚Äî everything about the books in stock.

- üë§ **Members**  
  Records each library user with details like member ID, full name, contact info, and registration date.

- üí∞ **Fine Details**  
  Shows member fines based on late book returns, categorized by delay range.

- üöö **Suppliers**  
  Contains supplier ID, name, and contact details ‚Äî useful for tracking book sources.

- üì¶ **Book Issue**  
  Logs book borrowings with issue and return dates, member ID, book code, and any related fines.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The dataset was shared informally by a data analyst for personal learning and portfolio-building purposes. It‚Äôs not from a public domain but reflects structured LMS data typically found in educational and institutional settings.

**Conclusion**
The data analysis of the Library Management System will provide valuable insights into user behavior, inventory management, and overall library operations. By addressing the 30 queries provided by the library owner, we can uncover important trends and metrics that can help optimize library services, enhance user satisfaction, and support strategic decision-making. The comprehensive reports generated from the SQL queries will serve as a foundation for ongoing monitoring and improvement of the library's operations.
